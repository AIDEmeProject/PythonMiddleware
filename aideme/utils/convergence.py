All functions in the module are possible criteria for stopping the exploration process. A valid "convergence criteria"
is any function with the following signature:

    def convergence_criteria(manager: ExplorationManager, metrics: Metrics):
        return True if exploration can stop, False otherwise

Here, 'manager' is an ExplorationManager instance containing the current state of the AL exploration (i.e. data and learner),
and 'metrics' is the dictionary of all metrics which have been computed in the last iteration.
